        <h3>Strategic Planning</h3>
        <p>Throughout my current MSc I have learnt  how to use many tools needed for strategic planning, some examples are; road and eco-system mapping, design thinking and SWOT analysis. I have further helped a PHD student with the commercial strategy of their Medical Engineering project involving gene activated scaffolds for osteoarthritis and acted as a consultant to the sustainability service at the University with the <a
